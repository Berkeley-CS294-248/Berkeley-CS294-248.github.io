<h1>Quick Self-test</h1>

Should you take CS294-248?  Here is a <i><u>very simple</u></i> test
for you to help you decide: if you cannot answer more than 2-3
questions below, then you probably shouldn't take this class.  

<ol>
  <li>What are the complexity classes NP, PSpace, PTIME?</li>
  <li>What is the transitive closure of a graph?</li>
  <li>Consider a relation R(A,B,C).  What does the functional
    dependency A &#8594; B mean?</li>
  <li>A relation R(A,B) has 100 tuples, and a relation S(B,C) has 500
  tuples.  What is the maximum number of tuples that the natural join
  R &#10781; S can have?  What about the minimum number of
  tuples?</li>
  <li>Let R = {a,b,c}, S = {b,c,d}, T = {a,b,e}, K = {f,g}
    Compute ((R-S) &#8746; T) &#215; K.
  <li>Suppose the relations R(A,B) and S(B,C) have N tuples each.
  Write an algorithm to check whether this formula is true:
  &#8704; x (&#8707; y (R(x,y) &#8594; &#8707; z S(y,z))).  What is
    the asymptotic runtime of your algorithm?</li>
  <li>What is the asymptotic complexity of the following algorithms:
    <ol>
      <li>Searching for a value x in an array of N elements.</li>
      <li>Searching for a value x in a sorted array of N elements.</li>
      <li>Merging two sorted arrays of length N.</li>
      <li>Quicksort</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A relation R(A,B) has 1000 tuples.  We create a new relation
  S(A,B) as follows.  With start with S=the emptyset, then we iterate
  over all tuples in R, and, for each tuple, we insert it in S with
    probability 3%.  What is the expected number of tuples in S?</li>
  <li>Continuing the question above, suppose that A is a key in R.  Is
    A also a key in S?</li>
  <li>Let R(A,B,C) be a relation with 3 attributes, and the following
  content: R = {(i mod 2, i mod 3, i mod 6) | i = 0,..,5}.  Which
    attribute(s) form a key in R?</li>
</ol>
